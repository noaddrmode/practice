// Overview

// The problem would have been simpler if we are allowed to use extra space.

// We can create a map which stores all unique array elements as the key and element frequency as the value.

// After populating our map, we get all the unique elements from our array.

// We then iterate our map and push all the keys in our input array

// However, without using extra space it makes it a bit tricky as we have to modify the existing input array
// Approach 1: Two indexes approach
// Intuition

// To solve the problem, let's look at the condition carefully,

//     It is guaranteed that the given array is a sorted array.

// Let k be the count of unique elements in our input array.

//     It doesn't matter what elements we place after the first k elements.

// From the condition, we can have a few observations here,

//     Since the array we have is sorted, all duplicate values will be one after the other.

//     We need to update the first k elements in an array with unique values and return the value of k.

// Using the following intuition, let's understand how to address this problem.

//     The problem states that we need to fill the first k elements of an array with unique values
//     For doing so, we modify the input array in-place so that we don't use extra space
//     In order to perform in-place operations, we use the Two indexes approach
//     The first index updates the value in our input array while reading the data from the second index

//     First Index is responsible for writing unique values in our input array, while Second Index will read the input array and pass all the distinct elements to First Index.

//     We continue the above steps until the second index reaches the end of an array

// Algorithm

// By analyzing the above three key observations, we can derive the following algorithm,

//     Start both indexes (insertIndex, i) from 1.

//     insertIndex and i represents our First and second Index respectively.

//     Check if the previous element is different from the current element

//     The previous element is the element just before our i index i.e element present at arr[i-1]

//     If found different then perform arr[insertIndex] = arr[i] and increment insertIndex by 1

//     Increment i index by 1 till we reach end of the array

//         Note: After reaching the end of the array, our insertIndex variable will hold the count of unique elements in our input array.
